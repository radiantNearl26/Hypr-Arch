# Delete this folder

This file is made due to reasons similar to the one for making the file in ~/.config/systemd. So delete this folder, it contains auto-generated accels (done by xfce4-terminal.)
One more thing, shift to alacritty, it's better. This was my favourite go-to terminal before alacritty. So, don't wanna delete it. So....

bash
Again guys, breadcrumbs are UI elements, but yeah, they are food too!
